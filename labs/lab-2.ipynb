    "### 3. Backpropagation\n",
    "Backpropagation is a method used to calculate the error contribution of each layer after a batch of data. It is a special case of an older and more general technique called automatic differentiation. In the context of learning, backpropagation is commonly used by the gradient descent optimization algorithm to adjust the weight of layers by calculating the gradient of the loss function. This technique is also sometimes called backward propagation of errors, because the error is calculated at the output and distributed back through the network layers. The main motivation of method is simplify evaluation of gradient which is complex problem for multilayer nets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need the following notation. Let $(y^1,\\dots,y^n) = f(x^1,\\dots,x^n)$ is some differentiable function and $\\frac{dy}{dx}$ is matrix\n",
    "$$\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\Big[ J_{ij} = \\frac{\\partial y^i}{\\partial x^j} \\Big]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without violating the generality, we can assume that each layer is a function $x_{i} = f(x_{i-1}, w_i)$. As last layer we add loss function, so we can assume our multi-layer net as function $Q(x_0) = Q(f_n(f_{n-1}(\\dots, w_{n-1}), w_n))$.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{dQ}{dw_n} = \\frac{dQ}{dx_n}\\frac{dx_n}{dw_n} \\text{ and } \\frac{dQ}{dx_{n-1}} = \\frac{dQ}{dx_n}\\frac{dx_n}{dx_{n-1}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need calculate $\\frac{dQ}{dw_{n-2}}$ и $\\frac{dQ}{dx_{n-2}}$. But we have the same situation. We know $\\frac{dQ}{dx_k}$, so can evaluate $\\frac{dQ}{dw_k}$ and $\\frac{dQ}{dx_{k-1}}$. Repeating this operation we find all the gradients. Now it's only remains to make a gradient step to update weights.\n",

    "### 4. Autoencoders\n",
    "An autoencoder is an network used for unsupervised learning of efficient codings. The aim of an autoencoder is to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction. Also, this technique can be used to train deep nets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Architecturally, the simplest form of an autoencoder is a feedforward net very similar to the multilayer perceptron (MLP), but with the output layer having the same number of nodes as the input layer, and with the purpose of reconstructing its own inputs. Therefore, autoencoders are unsupervised learning models. An autoencoder always consists of two parts, the encoder and the decoder. Encoder returns latent representation of the object (compressed representation, usuallu smaller dimension), but decoder restores object from this latent representation. Autoencoders are also trained to minimise reconstruction errors (e.g. MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "Various techniques exist to prevent autoencoders from learning the identity and to improve their ability to capture important information:\n",
    "1. Denoising autoencoder - take a partially corrupted input.\n",
    "2. Sparse autoencoder - impose sparsity on the hidden units during training (whilst having a larger number of hidden units than inputs).\n",
    "3. Variational autoencoder models inherit autoencoder architecture, but make strong assumptions concerning the distribution of latent variables.\n",
    "4. Contractive autoencoder - add an explicit regularizer in objective function that forces the model to learn a function that is robust to slight variations of input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercises\n",
    "1. Train 2 layers autoencoder that compressed mnist images to $\\mathbb{R}^3$ space.\n",
    "2. For each digit plot several samples in 3D axis (use \"%matplotlib notebook\" mode or plotly). How do digits group?\n",
    "3. Train autoencoder with more layers. What are results?\n",
    "4. Use autoencoder to pretrain 2 layers (unsupervised) and then train the following layers with supervised method."
